  { id:"Stoicism", name:"Stoicism", brief:"Virtue through rational self-mastery and acceptance of what we cannot control.",
    synopsis:"The Stoics taught that happiness comes from aligning yourself with nature and reason â€” not from wealth, fame, or pleasure. Their core insight is the dichotomy of control: focus entirely on what you can control (your judgments, choices, and character) and accept everything else with equanimity. Emotions like anger and anxiety arise not from events themselves but from our judgments about events. Change the judgment, and the disturbance dissolves.",
    origin:"Founded by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE, Stoicism emerged during a period of political upheaval after Alexander the Great's conquests shattered the familiar Greek city-state. In an unstable world, people needed a philosophy that could provide inner peace regardless of external circumstances. Stoicism became the dominant philosophy of the Roman Empire.",
    thinkers:["Zeno of Citium","Epictetus","Seneca","Marcus Aurelius","Cleanthes"] },
  { id:"Platonism", name:"Platonism", brief:"Reality consists of eternal Forms; the physical world is their imperfect copy.",
    synopsis:"Plato argued that the physical world we perceive is not truly real â€” it is a world of shadows and imperfect copies. True reality consists of eternal, unchanging Forms: perfect abstractions like Justice, Beauty, and the Good. Knowledge is not derived from the senses but from rational contemplation of these Forms. The soul is immortal and has access to the Forms through reason and philosophical inquiry.",
    origin:"Platonism grew from Socrates' insistence that concepts like justice and beauty have real, objective definitions â€” Plato extended this into a full metaphysical system. His Academy (founded c. 387 BCE) became the institutional home of this tradition, which dominated Western philosophy for centuries and profoundly shaped Christian theology.",
    thinkers:["Plato","Plotinus","Proclus","Augustine (influenced)","Marsilio Ficino","Iris Murdoch"] },
  { id:"Aristotelianism", name:"Aristotelianism", brief:"Knowledge through observation; virtue as the golden mean between extremes.",
    synopsis:"Aristotle rejected Plato's separate realm of Forms, arguing that form and matter are always united in particular things. Knowledge comes from careful observation and logical analysis of the world around us. In ethics, virtue lies in the golden mean between excess and deficiency, developed through practice until right action becomes habit. Every thing has a natural purpose (telos), and flourishing means fulfilling that purpose excellently.",
    origin:"Aristotle studied at Plato's Academy for twenty years but broke with his teacher's idealism, insisting that philosophy must engage with the observable world. His Lyceum (founded 335 BCE) became a center for empirical research. Aristotelianism dominated medieval thought through its synthesis with Christian theology by Thomas Aquinas.",
    thinkers:["Aristotle","Theophrastus","Avicenna","Averroes","Thomas Aquinas","Maimonides","Martha Nussbaum"] },
  { id:"Epicureanism", name:"Epicureanism", brief:"The good life consists of simple pleasures, friendship, and freedom from fear.",
    synopsis:"Often misunderstood as hedonism, Epicureanism actually teaches that the highest pleasure is ataraxia â€” tranquility and the absence of suffering. Epicurus advocated simple living, deep friendships, philosophical reflection, and above all, freedom from two great fears: fear of the gods (who, he argued, are indifferent to us) and fear of death (which we will never experience). Physical pleasures matter less than peace of mind.",
    origin:"Epicurus founded the Garden in Athens around 307 BCE â€” a philosophical community that radically welcomed women and enslaved people. His philosophy emerged as an alternative to the anxieties of Hellenistic life, offering happiness not through power or wealth but through withdrawal into a community of friends devoted to simple living and rational inquiry.",
    thinkers:["Epicurus","Lucretius","Metrodorus","Hermarchus","Pierre Gassendi"] },
  { id:"Skepticism", name:"Skepticism", brief:"Questioning whether certain or absolute knowledge is possible.",
    synopsis:"The Skeptics argued that for every philosophical claim, an equally compelling counter-argument can be found. Since we can never be truly certain our beliefs are correct, the path to tranquility is epochÃ© â€” the suspension of judgment. Rather than clinging to beliefs and suffering when they're challenged, we should accept the limits of human knowledge. This isn't nihilism â€” it's intellectual humility taken to its logical conclusion.",
    origin:"Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360-270 BCE) pioneered Skepticism after traveling with Alexander the Great to India, where he encountered radically different belief systems. If equally intelligent people hold contradictory beliefs, how can anyone claim certainty? Later Skeptics like Sextus Empiricus developed this into a rigorous philosophical method that profoundly influenced Descartes, Hume, and the scientific method itself.",
    thinkers:["Pyrrho","Sextus Empiricus","Arcesilaus","Carneades","Michel de Montaigne","David Hume"] },
  { id:"Rationalism", name:"Rationalism", brief:"True knowledge comes from reason alone, independent of sensory experience.",
    synopsis:"Rationalists argued that the most important truths â€” mathematical, logical, and metaphysical â€” can be known through pure reason, without relying on the senses. Our senses can deceive us (optical illusions, hallucinations, dreams), but logical truths cannot be false. The mind possesses innate ideas or principles that provide the foundation for genuine knowledge. Reason, not experience, is the ultimate authority.",
    origin:"Modern rationalism emerged in the 17th century as Descartes, shaken by skeptical challenges, sought an unshakable foundation for knowledge. His method of radical doubt â€” systematically questioning everything until he reached the indubitable 'I think, therefore I am' â€” launched a philosophical revolution. Spinoza and Leibniz extended this confidence in reason into comprehensive systems of metaphysics.",
    thinkers:["RenÃ© Descartes","Baruch Spinoza","Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz","Nicolas Malebranche","Christian Wolff"] },
  { id:"Empiricism", name:"Empiricism", brief:"All knowledge ultimately derives from sensory experience.",
    synopsis:"Empiricists insisted that the mind at birth is a blank slate â€” there are no innate ideas. Everything we know comes from what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. Concepts that seem to be 'pure reason' (like causation) are actually habits formed by repeated experience. This means our knowledge is always limited by what we can observe, and claims that go beyond experience (about God, the soul, or ultimate reality) are suspect.",
    origin:"British empiricism arose in the 17th-18th centuries as a reaction against rationalist claims of innate knowledge. Locke, Berkeley, and Hume each pushed the empiricist program further, asking: if all knowledge comes from experience, what do we actually know? Hume's devastating conclusion â€” that we can't even justify belief in causation â€” forced Kant to develop his revolutionary synthesis.",
    thinkers:["John Locke","George Berkeley","David Hume","Francis Bacon","John Stuart Mill"] },
  { id:"Idealism", name:"Idealism", brief:"Reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual in nature.",
    synopsis:"Idealists argue that what we call 'reality' is ultimately constituted by mind, consciousness, or spirit â€” not by matter existing independently of perception. This ranges from Berkeley's claim that physical objects are collections of sensory ideas sustained by God's mind, to Hegel's grand vision of all reality as the progressive self-realization of Absolute Spirit through history. Idealism takes seriously the fact that we never experience a world independent of consciousness.",
    origin:"Philosophical idealism has ancient roots in Plato, but it became a dominant force in the 18th-19th centuries. Kant argued that the mind structures all experience (transcendental idealism). Hegel radicalized this into absolute idealism â€” the claim that reality itself is rational and spiritual. German idealism was the most ambitious philosophical movement since ancient Greece and shaped Marx, existentialism, and much of modern thought.",
    thinkers:["George Berkeley","Immanuel Kant","G.W.F. Hegel","Arthur Schopenhauer","J.G. Fichte","F.W.J. Schelling"] },
  { id:"Existentialism", name:"Existentialism", brief:"Individual existence, freedom, and choice are the starting point of philosophy.",
    synopsis:"Existentialism insists that philosophy must begin with the concrete, lived experience of the individual â€” not with abstract systems or universal truths. 'Existence precedes essence': we are not born with a fixed nature or purpose; we must create ourselves through our choices. This radical freedom is both exhilarating and terrifying â€” we are 'condemned to be free,' with no excuses and no one to blame. Authenticity means owning this freedom rather than hiding behind roles, conventions, or bad faith.",
    origin:"Existentialism emerged from the crisis of meaning in 19th-20th century Europe. Kierkegaard rejected Hegel's grand system in favor of individual faith and decision. Nietzsche declared the 'death of God' and asked how we create meaning without cosmic guarantees. After two World Wars shattered European civilization, Sartre and de Beauvoir made existentialism the philosophy of a generation confronting absurdity, freedom, and responsibility. Camus, though often grouped with the existentialists, rejected the label and developed his own philosophy of the Absurd.",
    thinkers:["SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard","Friedrich Nietzsche","Jean-Paul Sartre","Simone de Beauvoir","Martin Heidegger","Maurice Merleau-Ponty","Frantz Fanon"] },
  { id:"Phenomenology", name:"Phenomenology", brief:"Philosophy must describe the structures of consciousness and lived experience.",
    synopsis:"Phenomenology is the rigorous study of how things appear to consciousness. By 'bracketing' our assumptions about whether the external world exists (the epochÃ©), phenomenologists describe the pure structures of experience: how we perceive objects, constitute meaning, experience time, and relate to other people. The goal is to return to 'the things themselves' â€” to describe experience as it is actually lived, before scientific theories and philosophical assumptions distort it.",
    origin:"Edmund Husserl founded phenomenology in the early 20th century as a response to the crisis in European sciences. He believed philosophy had lost its way by imitating natural science rather than investigating consciousness itself. Heidegger transformed phenomenology into an investigation of Being and human existence, while Merleau-Ponty extended it to the body and perception. It became the methodological foundation of existentialism and much of Continental philosophy.",
    thinkers:["Edmund Husserl","Martin Heidegger","Jean-Paul Sartre","Maurice Merleau-Ponty","Hannah Arendt","Emmanuel Levinas"] },
  { id:"Analytic Philosophy", name:"Analytic", brief:"Clarity through logical analysis of language and concepts.",
    synopsis:"Analytic philosophy holds that many philosophical problems arise from confusion about language. By analyzing concepts with logical precision, we can dissolve pseudo-problems and make genuine progress on real ones. It prizes clarity, rigor, and argumentation over literary style or grand theorizing. Its methods â€” formal logic, thought experiments, careful definition of terms â€” have made it the dominant tradition in English-speaking philosophy departments.",
    origin:"Analytic philosophy emerged in the early 20th century when Russell and Moore rebelled against the obscurity of British idealism. Wittgenstein's Tractatus argued that the structure of language mirrors the structure of reality. The logical positivists took this further, claiming that statements not verifiable by experience or logic are literally meaningless. Though logical positivism collapsed, its commitment to clarity and logical rigor defined a philosophical tradition that continues to thrive.",
    thinkers:["Bertrand Russell","Ludwig Wittgenstein","G.E. Moore","W.V.O. Quine","Karl Popper","G.E.M. Anscombe","Saul Kripke"] },
  { id:"Marxism", name:"Marxism", brief:"History is driven by material conditions and class struggle.",
    synopsis:"Marx argued that the economic structure of society â€” who owns the means of production â€” determines politics, law, culture, religion, and ideas. The history of civilization is the history of class struggle between those who own and those who labor. Capitalism, while enormously productive, alienates workers from their labor, their products, and ultimately from themselves. It generates its own destruction through internal contradictions, eventually giving way to a classless society.",
    origin:"Marxism emerged in the mid-19th century as industrial capitalism transformed Europe, creating unprecedented wealth alongside horrific working conditions. Marx turned Hegel's dialectic 'right side up': instead of ideas driving history, material economic conditions do. His analysis â€” that economic power shapes all other aspects of society â€” remains one of the most influential frameworks in the social sciences, regardless of one's politics.",
    thinkers:["Karl Marx","Friedrich Engels","Antonio Gramsci","Rosa Luxemburg","Herbert Marcuse"] },
  { id:"Classical Liberalism", name:"Classical Liberalism", brief:"Natural rights, individual liberty, limited government, and consent of the governed.",
    synopsis:"Classical liberalism holds that individuals possess natural rights â€” endowed by God or nature â€” to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are pre-political: they exist before government and cannot be legitimately taken away by any government. Political authority derives solely from the consent of the governed. The purpose of government is to protect individual freedom, and power must be limited, divided, and accountable. These ideas are the philosophical foundation of the American Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and modern constitutional democracy worldwide. Note: 'Classical liberalism' is not what Americans typically mean by 'liberal' in everyday politics. In fact, many positions associated with the modern American left â€” particularly those rooted in critical theory, postmodernism, and social constructionism â€” stand in direct philosophical contradiction to classical liberalism's foundational claims about natural rights, objective truth, and the sovereignty of the individual.",
    origin:"Classical liberalism emerged from the religious wars and political upheavals of 17th-century Europe. Locke's Two Treatises of Government argued that people have pre-political natural rights and may overthrow tyrannical governments. Montesquieu's separation of powers, the Scottish Enlightenment's moral philosophy, and Paine's revolutionary pamphlets translated these ideas into political reality. The American Revolution was classical liberalism's greatest achievement â€” the first time a nation was founded explicitly on philosophical principles about natural rights and the consent of the governed. Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and Franklin turned Enlightenment philosophy into a constitutional republic that has endured for over two centuries.",
    thinkers:["John Locke","Voltaire","Montesquieu","Adam Smith","Jeremy Bentham","Thomas Paine","Thomas Jefferson","James Madison","Alexander Hamilton","Benjamin Franklin","Mary Wollstonecraft","Thomas Reid","John Stuart Mill","Friedrich Hayek","Ludwig von Mises","Robert Nozick","Isaiah Berlin"] },
  { id:"Conservatism", name:"Conservatism", brief:"Inherited wisdom, tradition, and gradual reform over revolutionary upheaval.",
    synopsis:"Conservatism holds that human societies are complex, fragile, and shaped by centuries of accumulated wisdom embedded in traditions, customs, laws, and institutions. This inherited order cannot be safely replaced by abstract blueprints designed by intellectuals â€” however well-intentioned. Reform should be gradual and respectful of what exists. The conservative disposition values continuity, prudence, and the particular over the universal, and warns that revolutionary attempts to perfect society inevitably produce tyranny.",
    origin:"Modern conservatism was born in Edmund Burke's reaction to the French Revolution. While supporting the American Revolution (which he saw as defending inherited rights), Burke argued that the French attempt to rebuild society from scratch, guided by abstract 'rights of man,' would destroy the social fabric and end in bloodshed â€” as it did. His insight that tradition embodies practical wisdom that reason alone cannot replicate has shaped conservative thought from Oakeshott to Scruton.",
    thinkers:["Edmund Burke","Alexis de Tocqueville","Michael Oakeshott","Roger Scruton"] },
  { id:"Social Contract", name:"Social Contract", brief:"Political authority derives from an agreement among individuals to form a society.",
    synopsis:"Social contract theory holds that legitimate political authority is not natural or divinely ordained but arises from an agreement â€” real or hypothetical â€” among individuals. People consent to surrender some freedoms in exchange for social order and the protection of their remaining rights. Different social contract thinkers reach radically different conclusions: Hobbes argued for absolute sovereignty, Locke for limited government protecting natural rights, Rousseau for direct democracy guided by the general will, and Rawls for egalitarian principles chosen behind a 'veil of ignorance.'",
    origin:"Social contract theory emerged as an alternative to divine right monarchy. Hobbes, writing during the English Civil War, argued that without government, life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short' â€” so rational people would agree to submit to a sovereign. Locke modified this: the contract is conditional on the government protecting natural rights. Rousseau radicalized it: the social contract must express the general will of all citizens. Rawls revived the tradition in the 20th century with his hypothetical contract behind the veil of ignorance.",
    thinkers:["Thomas Hobbes","John Locke","Jean-Jacques Rousseau","John Rawls"] },
  { id:"Objectivism", name:"Objectivism", brief:"Reality exists objectively; reason, self-interest, and individual rights are moral absolutes.",
    synopsis:"Objectivism, developed by Ayn Rand, is a comprehensive philosophical system. It holds that reality exists independently of consciousness (metaphysics), that reason is the only means of knowledge (epistemology), that the purpose of life is the rational pursuit of one's own happiness (ethics), that individual rights are absolute (politics), and that laissez-faire capitalism is the only moral social system. Altruism â€” defined as the doctrine that self-sacrifice for others is the moral ideal â€” is rejected as destructive to both the individual and society.",
    origin:"Rand developed Objectivism after fleeing Soviet Russia and witnessing firsthand the consequences of collectivism. Her novels The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957) dramatized her philosophy through heroic individuals battling conformity, mediocrity, and state power. While often dismissed by academic philosophers, Objectivism has had enormous popular influence and inspired the modern libertarian movement.",
    thinkers:["Ayn Rand"] },
  { id:"Scholasticism", name:"Scholasticism", brief:"Rigorous use of Aristotelian logic to systematize and defend Christian theology.",
    synopsis:"Scholasticism was the dominant intellectual method of medieval European universities. Its practitioners sought to reconcile the philosophical inheritance of ancient Greece â€” especially Aristotle â€” with Christian, Islamic, and Jewish revelation. The scholastic method was dialectical: pose a question, present objections, offer a resolution grounded in both reason and authority, then answer each objection systematically. The result was a series of monumental summae â€” comprehensive systems that attempted to organize all human knowledge under a unified rational framework. At its best, Scholasticism produced some of the most rigorous philosophical argumentation in history; at its worst, it degenerated into hairsplitting disputes over trivial distinctions.",
    origin:"Scholasticism emerged in the 11th-12th centuries as the works of Aristotle, transmitted through Arabic translations by scholars like Avicenna and Averroes, flooded into European universities and created an intellectual crisis: how could pagan philosophy be reconciled with Christian faith? Anselm's ontological argument and Abelard's dialectical method laid the groundwork. Thomas Aquinas achieved the tradition's supreme synthesis in his Summa Theologica, demonstrating that faith and reason are complementary paths to truth. William of Ockham's nominalism later challenged the system from within, helping to dissolve it by the 15th century.",
    thinkers:["Thomas Aquinas","Anselm of Canterbury","Peter Abelard","Duns Scotus","William of Ockham","Albertus Magnus"] },
  { id:"Humanism", name:"Humanism", brief:"The dignity, potential, and centrality of the human being as the measure of knowledge and value.",
    synopsis:"Renaissance humanism was not a philosophical system but an intellectual movement that placed human experience, human achievement, and human potential at the center of thought. Humanists turned from the abstract logic of the medieval schools to the literary, historical, and moral writings of ancient Greece and Rome â€” the studia humanitatis. They believed that reading the classics directly (in the original Greek and Latin, not in scholastic commentaries) would cultivate eloquence, moral judgment, and civic virtue. The goal was not to abandon Christianity but to enrich it with the wisdom of antiquity and to produce well-rounded human beings capable of active participation in public life.",
    origin:"Humanism began in 14th-century Italy with Petrarch, who championed the recovery of classical Latin literature and attacked the Scholastics for their barbarous style and narrow focus. Erasmus brought humanism to Northern Europe, combining classical learning with biblical scholarship and gentle satire of Church corruption. Thomas More's Utopia imagined a society governed by humanist principles of reason and tolerance. The movement's insistence on returning to original sources (ad fontes) fueled both the Renaissance and the Reformation, and its faith in education as the path to human flourishing remains the foundation of liberal arts education today.",
    thinkers:["Petrarch","Erasmus","Thomas More","Michel de Montaigne","Giordano Bruno","Pico della Mirandola","Lorenzo Valla","Marsilio Ficino"] },
  { id:"Utilitarianism", name:"Utilitarianism", brief:"The right action is the one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number.",
    synopsis:"Utilitarianism holds that the morality of an action is determined entirely by its consequences â€” specifically, by the amount of happiness or well-being it produces. The principle is elegantly egalitarian: everyone's happiness counts equally, and the right thing to do is whatever maximizes total well-being. Bentham developed a 'felicific calculus' to quantify pleasure and pain. Mill refined this by distinguishing higher pleasures (intellectual, aesthetic) from lower pleasures (merely physical), insisting that quality of happiness matters, not just quantity. Later utilitarians like Peter Singer extended the principle to include animal suffering, while rule utilitarians argued that we should follow rules that generally maximize happiness rather than calculating consequences case by case.",
    origin:"Utilitarianism emerged in 18th-19th century Britain as a reform movement. Bentham, appalled by the irrationality and cruelty of English law, proposed that all legislation should be judged by a single standard: does it increase or decrease the total happiness of those affected? This principle drove campaigns to reform prisons, expand voting rights, decriminalize homosexuality, and protect animal welfare. Mill extended utilitarianism into a sophisticated moral philosophy compatible with individual liberty and justice. Today, utilitarian reasoning underlies cost-benefit analysis in public policy, the effective altruism movement, and much of applied ethics.",
    thinkers:["Jeremy Bentham","John Stuart Mill","Henry Sidgwick","R.M. Hare","Peter Singer"] },
  { id:"Pragmatism", name:"Pragmatism", brief:"Ideas are tools for navigating reality; truth is what works in practice.",
    synopsis:"Pragmatism is America's distinctive contribution to world philosophy. It rejects the traditional search for absolute, timeless truths and asks instead: what practical difference does a belief make? If two theories produce identical practical consequences, then the dispute between them is meaningless. Truth is not a fixed correspondence between mind and world but a dynamic quality that belongs to ideas that successfully guide action and inquiry. Pragmatism is anti-dogmatic, pluralistic, and experimental â€” it treats all beliefs as hypotheses to be tested against experience and revised when they fail. It is as much a temperament as a doctrine: fallibilist, democratic, forward-looking, and suspicious of any philosophy that has no connection to lived human experience.",
    origin:"Charles Sanders Peirce founded pragmatism in the 1870s with his 'pragmatic maxim': to clarify the meaning of a concept, consider what practical effects it would have. William James popularized the movement, extending it into psychology, religion, and the public imagination. John Dewey applied pragmatist principles to education, democracy, and social reform, arguing that philosophy should be a tool for solving real human problems rather than an exercise in abstract system-building. Pragmatism fell out of academic fashion mid-century but was revived by Richard Rorty and continues to influence American philosophy, education theory, and public policy.",
    thinkers:["Charles Sanders Peirce","William James","John Dewey","W.E.B. Du Bois","Richard Rorty","Hilary Putnam"] },
  { id:"Postmodernism", name:"Postmodernism", brief:"Skepticism toward grand narratives, universal truths, and stable meanings.",
    synopsis:"Postmodernism is less a unified philosophy than a broad intellectual sensibility that emerged in the late 20th century. Its central claim is that the great stories ('metanarratives') that Western civilization has told about itself â€” the march of progress, the triumph of reason, the liberation of humanity through science and democracy â€” are not universal truths but particular stories told by particular people to serve particular interests. Postmodernists argue that what we call 'truth,' 'knowledge,' and 'reality' are shaped by language, culture, and power in ways that are usually invisible to us. There is no 'view from nowhere,' no neutral standpoint from which to assess reality; all knowledge is situated, partial, and perspectival. This makes postmodernism a powerful tool for questioning authority and revealing hidden assumptions â€” and, its critics argue, a corrosive force that undermines the very possibility of truth, morality, and rational discourse.",
    origin:"Postmodernism grew from several intellectual roots. Nietzsche's perspectivism questioned whether objective truth exists. Heidegger's critique of Western metaphysics argued that the entire philosophical tradition had taken a wrong turn. In France, Lyotard declared the 'end of grand narratives,' Derrida argued that texts deconstruct their own claims to stable meaning, and Foucault revealed how knowledge systems serve as instruments of social control. By the 1980s, postmodern ideas had spread from philosophy into literary criticism, architecture, art, and eventually into education, law, and politics â€” where they became the subject of intense cultural debate that continues today.",
    thinkers:["Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard","Jacques Derrida","Michel Foucault","Richard Rorty","Fredric Jameson","Jean Baudrillard"] },
